# ðŸ§¥ YOLOv11 Transfer Learning for Clothes Detection

This project applies **transfer learning** on the YOLOv11 (Ultralytics YOLOv8-compatible) object detection model to classify and localize 18 categories of clothing. The model was fine-tuned on a custom-labeled apparel dataset, achieving strong performance on unseen test images.

ðŸ”¹ 2.1.5 Batch-wise Prediction vs Ground Truth (Visual Analysis)
To complement numerical evaluation, we visualized prediction results for randomly sampled training and validation batches:

Figure 2.1.5a: train_batch0.jpg to train_batch21062.jpg show ground truth annotations in the training set.

Figure 2.1.5b: val_batch0_labels.jpg, val_batch1_labels.jpg, val_batch2_labels.jpg show validation ground truth labels.

Figure 2.1.5c: val_batch0_pred.jpg, val_batch1_pred.jpg, val_batch2_pred.jpg display model predictions for the same validation samples.

Key Observations:

The model shows consistent performance across batches, especially for frequent classes like shortpants, skirt, and cottonpants.

Confidence scores are generally high, often exceeding 0.85 for clean, well-lit samples (e.g., shortsleeve: 0.93, blazer: 0.97).

Lower performance is observed on rare or visually similar categories (e.g., zipup, padding), aligning with class imbalance insights.

ðŸ”¹ 2.1.6 False Positive / False Negative Examples (Qualitative Errors)
We additionally analyzed ff2dbe3f-bf0a-4bbc-b704-21ad9ca3ea46.jpg to identify qualitative errors:

False Positives: Some predictions identified garments that were not labeled in the ground truth, often due to ambiguous occlusions or complex garment overlaps (e.g., skirt misclassified as shortpants).

False Negatives: In a few cases, true garments were missed, particularly when darker clothing blended into the background or partially occluded (e.g., hoodie under jacket).

These examples demonstrate the need for:

Tuning the confidence threshold,

Post-processing steps like non-maximum suppression adjustment, or

Introducing context-aware modules for better fine-grained apparel detection.

ðŸ”¹ 2.1.7 Label-Prediction Match Consistency
To assess localization and semantic agreement, we directly compared ground truth and predicted labels:

val_batch0_labels.jpg to val_batch2_labels.jpg vs. val_batch0_pred.jpg to val_batch2_pred.jpg.

Findings:

High bounding box alignment was observed (visually consistent IOU), confirming strong spatial learning.

However, semantic confusion occurred among similar garments:

Cardigan â†” Jacket

Slacks â†” Cottonpants

This highlights the importance of consistent labeling and perhaps the need for hierarchical class grouping during training.
