# 🧥 YOLOv11 Transfer Learning for Clothes Detection

This project applies **transfer learning** on the YOLOv11 (Ultralytics YOLOv8-compatible) object detection model to classify and localize 18 categories of clothing. The model was fine-tuned on a custom-labeled apparel dataset, achieving strong performance on unseen test images.

🔹 Evaluation Results
    The trained model was evaluated using a combination of quantitative metrics and visual analysis.
    This section summarizes the key outcomes from the evaluation phase.

🔹 Confusion Matrix Analysis
    To evaluate inter-class confusion, both the absolute and normalized confusion matrices were analyzed:

    • Most predictions align well along the diagonal, indicating strong classification accuracy.
    • High accuracy was observed for classes such as shortpants, shortsleeve, and denimpants.
    • Some confusion was noted among visually similar categories, such as jacket, cardigan, sweater, and longsleeve.

    Image 2 – Normalized Confusion Matrix (proportions)

🔹 Confidence-Based Metric Curves
    Confidence-based evaluation curves were plotted to understand how the model behaves across different confidence thresholds:

    • Most classes show stable precision and recall in the confidence range of 0.7–0.9.
    • shortsleeve and shortpants achieved exceptionally high scores across all confidence levels.
    • On the other hand, zipup showed lower performance, likely due to visual overlap with similar items and data scarcity.

    Image 4 – F1 Score vs. Confidence Curve
    Image 5 – Recall vs. Confidence Curve
    Image 6 – Precision-Recall Curve + mAP@0.5 (0.744)

🔹 Label Distribution and Bounding Box Analysis
    We also analyzed the label frequency distribution and spatial characteristics of bounding boxes:

    • denimpants, shortpants, and shortsleeve appeared frequently in the dataset, which correlates with their strong detection performance.
    • Bounding boxes are densely centered in the image frame, and their size distribution shows a healthy variety, reducing risk of spatial bias.

    Image 8 – Bounding box correlation plots (Correlogram)

🔹 Summary of Model Performance
    • The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.744 across all classes.
    • shortpants, shortsleeve, and skirt demonstrated the most robust performance, suggesting practical application potential.
    • Confusion among jacket-type garments suggests future improvements could involve fine-grained loss functions or more specialized model architectures.

🔹 Batch-wise Prediction vs Ground Truth (Visual Analysis)
    To complement numerical evaluation, we visualized prediction results for randomly sampled training and validation batches:

    Figure 2.1.5a: train_batch0.jpg to train_batch21062.jpg show ground truth annotations in the training set.
    Figure 2.1.5b: val_batch0_labels.jpg, val_batch1_labels.jpg, val_batch2_labels.jpg show validation ground truth labels.
    Figure 2.1.5c: val_batch0_pred.jpg, val_batch1_pred.jpg, val_batch2_pred.jpg display model predictions for the same validation samples.

    Key Observations:
    • The model shows consistent performance across batches, especially for frequent classes like shortpants, skirt, and cottonpants.
    • Confidence scores are generally high, often exceeding 0.85 for clean, well-lit samples (e.g., shortsleeve: 0.93, blazer: 0.97).
    • Rare classes like zipup or padding show lower prediction confidence and are occasionally confused with visually similar categories, reflecting the class imbalance noted in the training distribution.

🔹 False Positive / False Negative Examples (Qualitative Errors)
    The added figure (ff2dbe3f-bf0a-4bbc-b704-21ad9ca3ea46.jpg) demonstrates common misclassification patterns:

    • False Positives: Bounding boxes predicted for garments not present in ground truth, often caused by overlapping or ambiguous clothing views (e.g., shortpants vs. skirt).
    • False Negatives: Some garments annotated in the ground truth were completely missed — especially darker or partially occluded items (e.g., hoodie under jacket).

    This analysis suggests the need for improved post-processing and better threshold tuning in deployment.

🔹 Label-Prediction Match Consistency
    A side-by-side review of val_batch*_labels.jpg and val_batch*_pred.jpg showed:

    • High spatial consistency in predicted bounding boxes (visually aligned with ground truth).
    • Moderate confusion between semantically similar categories like cardigan vs. jacket, and slacks vs. cottonpants.
    • Emphasizes the need for consistent annotation guidelines when dealing with fine-grained apparel classes.

🔹 Overall Evaluation Summary
    The combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluation suggests the YOLO-based clothing detection model is effective across most categories.

    Strengths:
    • Strong generalization in diverse images (pose, lighting, occlusion).
    • mAP@0.5 = 0.744 with especially high scores on shortsleeve, shortpants, and skirt.
    • High confidence detection for common classes.

    Limitations:
    • Frequent misclassification between similar garments (e.g., jacket vs. cardigan).
    • Weak performance on rare or ambiguous classes like zipup, padding.

    Recommendations:
    • Incorporate fine-grained losses or hierarchical class structures.
    • Apply focal loss or class reweighting for imbalance.
    • Consider vision-language models (e.g., OWL-ViT, YOLO-World) for open-vocabulary detection.


## 📷 Real-time Detection by webcam
To test the trained model in real time using your laptop's webcam:

1. Install dependencies
  Make sure you have installed all required packages:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
2. Run the script
  Execute the following command in your terminal:
  ```
  python run_yolov11_webcam.py
  ```
3. Usage
  - A window will open showing your webcam feed with real-time bounding boxes and class labels.
  - Press q to close the window and stop the program.

Note:
  - The webcam index (0) is set for the default laptop camera. Change it to 1 or another index if you use an external camera.
  - Make sure the model weights path in the script matches your actual file location.
